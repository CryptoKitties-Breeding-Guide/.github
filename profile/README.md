## 🐾 What is CryptoKitties?

CryptoKitties is a collectible NFT game on the Ethereum blockchain where you collect, breed, and trade digital cats with unique genetic codes. Every Kitty is an ERC-721 token with 48 genetic traits (or “cattributes”), making breeding both a game of chance and strategy.

Breed rare cats, discover secret genes, and create generational lineages in the ultimate crypto-pet playground.

## 🧠 What's in This Assistant

- ✅ Genetic dominance chart for each trait  
- ✅ Cooldown optimization (faster breeding)  
- ✅ Cross-generation compatibility tips  
- ✅ Tips to discover hidden traits (recessives)  
- ✅ Value analysis: which traits are collectible?  
- ✅ Gassy Kitty: how to reduce ETH costs while breeding

## 🧩 Breeding Mechanics Overview

- Every Kitty has 256-bit DNA (48 traits: body, pattern, mouth, eyes, color, etc.)  
- Traits have dominance layers: D1 (visible), R1, R2, R3 (hidden)  
- Breeding uses Punnett square logic: hidden genes can “pop up” if matched  
- Cooldown levels range from “Fast” to “Catatonic” — faster = better  
- Gen 0 Kitties (originals) are rare and never breed again after the 50k supply was minted  

---

## 🎁 Hidden Secrets & Strategies

- 🧠 Breed two Kitties with matching R1 recessives to reveal rare traits  
- 🐾 Use the Fancy Kitty recipe tracker — many special cats require exact trait combos  
- 💸 Shorter cooldown = faster breeding = more marketplace flips  
- 📜 Watch for seasonal recipes (Dracula, SantaClaws, Momo-chan etc.)  
- 👑 Prestige traits (like “totesbasic”, “cymric”, “beard”) have higher resale value over time  
- 🔗 Some cats contain mutational genes only expressed on cooldown resets
